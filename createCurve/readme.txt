createCurve

THE PROJECT

  The idea behind this project was to create a simple C program for outputing a variety of "curves",
as represented by a CSV file. The ouput files contain approxiamtely ten thousand ordinal pairs, so
that they can fit in an excel spreadsheet. Each pair represents a one-tenth unit movement along
the x-axis. Users determine the destination of the output file, and a user may create as many CSV 
files in one execution of the program as they would like.
